This is Massively, a text-heavy, article-oriented design built around a huge background
image (with a new parallax implementation I'm testing) and scroll effects (powered by
Scrollex). A *slight* departure from all the one-pagers I've been doing lately, but one
that fulfills a few user requests and makes use of some new techniques I've been wanting
to try out. Enjoy it :)

In order to update portfolio:
-Create new repository utilizing UpdatedPortfolio for name
-Make sure VS code is up to date, uploading all the files into the new repository
-Unpublish current site, change name to "OutdatedPortfolio"
-Rename UpdatedPortfolio as hayleyreyes.github.io, save
-Go to pages, publish. Mess around with the buttons and be patient when hitting save. It sometimes takes a moment in order for it to publish



Try to only do this one or two more times when things are finalized since the tasks have been seen to be a bit tedious;
